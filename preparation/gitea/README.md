Adjust the **values.yaml** file to match your situation. You should change at least the following:

* ***\<GITEA-LB-IP\>*** - with the Load Balancer IP address that you want to use for Gitea

* ***\<GITEA-USER\>*** - with the username you want to use for Gitea

* ***\<GITEA-USER-PASSWORD\>*** - with the desired user password

* ***\<GITEA-USER-EMAIL\>*** - with an email address attached to the user
